					Hello! My name is Kody Brabson! Iâ€™m originally from Austin, Texas but I moved to Utah to marry my
					best friend, Alysse. I began my professional life in culinary art five years ago when I attended and
					graduated from Le Cordon Bleu. From there I moved over half the world to start cooking in France. I
					came back to the States for my long time friend who became very sick. He asked me to join him in his
					last years in Colorado. Over this time I honed my skills and my knives well enough to be an
					invaluable resource at any kitchen I went to. Eventually training and mentoring others in their own
					path to becoming chefs. When I met my wife I had already started thinking about getting out of the
					kitchen. She helped me decide to follow the career path of being a web developer. Through Devmontain
					I learned the base skill to start building the groundwork for the web developer career. Now as a
					full stack web developer I can build, design and craft sites. With your help I can hone the skills I
					know already and learn to use new skills to have a sharp set of web development knives at the ready.
					I look forward to working with you! Kody Brabson
