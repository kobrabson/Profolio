						Hello! My name is Kody Brabson! I am thrilled at the prospect of working in this industry and
						for your company. I am highly motivated and will bring a high level of enthusiasm and energy to
						this position. But first, I would like to introduce myself to you and provide you with some
						additional background information.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p className="text-size-mid indent">
						Though I am originally from Florida, I considered Texas my home as I moved to Austin when I was
						in middle school. However, I now call Utah home as I moved there in 2018 to marry my best
						friend, Alysse.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p className="text-size-mid indent">
						I began my professional life in culinary art five years ago when I attended and graduated from
						Le Cordon Bleu. I then continued my culinary adventure in northern France with some of the best
						chefs in the world. I learned that in addition to technical kitchen skills, I needed to have
						people management skills. Over time, I refined and sharpened both my soft skills and my knives
						well enough to be an invaluable resource in any kitchen I worked. I eventually began training
						and mentoring others in their own path to becoming chefs.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p className="text-size-mid indent">
						Since I was very young. I have had an interest in all forms of technology. I have loved being
						able to watch and participate in such incredible advancements. My first phone was a flip phone
						and it was cutting technology. Now, we literally walk around with a small computer in our hand â€“
						a computer with 100,000 times the processing power of the computer that landed Apollo 11 on the
						moon. Such implausible advances, which will no doubt continue, has only increased my interest
						and fascination in the information technology sphere.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p className="text-size-mid indent">
						During the covid pandemic, my food and beverage related job was eliminated. I used that
						opportunity to finally pursue a career in the technology information industry. After much
						research, web development appeared to be a perfect match for my interests and skills. In
						October, I completed the web development course at Devmountain certification. There I learn the
						basic skills set of Javascript, React, HTML, CSS Node.js, SQl, postgreSQL, and express.js. With
						the basic understanding of programming I have taken it upon myself to learn Angular, C#, and
						Java, just to name a few.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p className="text-size-mid indent">
						As a full stack web developer I can build, design and craft websites. In addition to those
						skills, I will bring passion for the industry and a commitment to continually learn and grow. My
						newly acquired web development knives are ready to be sharpened and used.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p className="text-size-mid">I look forward to talking with you soon</p>
					<br />
					<p className="text-size-mid">Sincerely,</p>
