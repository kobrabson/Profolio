						Hello! My name is Kody Brabson! I’m originally from Austin, Texas but I moved to Utah to marry
						my best friend, Alysse.
					</p>

						<span>{'   '}</span>
						I began my professional life in culinary art five years ago when I attended and graduated from
						Le Cordon Bleu. From there I moved over half the world to start cooking in France. That is where
						I began my culinary adventure with some of the best chefs in northern France. Over this time I
						honed my skills and my knives well enough to be an invaluable resource at any kitchen I went to.
						Eventually training and mentoring others in their own path to becoming chefs when I return to
						the state.
					</p>
					<br />

						Since I was just a kid I have had an interest in technology and seeing it evolve over time. From
						having the old flip phone and start of the internet to the smart phones we have now and the max
						media outlets we have now. Only increased my interest in the tech world but never had the
						opportunity or the resources to pursue a career in the tech world.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<span>{'   '}</span>
						During the covid pandemic I lost my job because food and beverage was one of the first things to
						close down. I couldn’t sit and wait for the pandemic to hopefully calm down enough to go back to
						work. My wife and I talked about going back to school. The first thing that came to mind was web
						development. After that I found Devmountain and almost immediately started. There I learn the
						basic skills set of Javascript, React, HTML, CSS Node.js, SQl, postgreSQL, and express.js. With
						the basic under my belt I have taken it upon myself to learn Angular, C#, and Java, just to name
						a few.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<span>{'   '}</span>
						Now as a full stack web developer I can build, design and craft sites. I am a self-focused,
						hard-work, and goal-oriented indvisional. With your help I can hone the skills already know and
						learn to use new skills to have a sharp set of web development knives at the ready.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>I look forward to working with you!</p>
